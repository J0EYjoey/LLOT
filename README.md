# LLOT: application of Laplacian Linear Optimal Transport in spatial transcriptome reconstruction
LLOT is a computational method to integrate a spatial transcriptomic
dataset and a reference scRNA-seq dataset to perform the three tasks: spatial expression prediction, cell location inference and cell-type deconvolution.
